HERA statistical analysis and null tests
========================================

The ``hera_stats`` module provides a collection of functions and container 
objects to help calculate various statistics on sets of delay spectra, and 
manage splits and other aspects of null tests.

You can find the code in the ``hera_stats`` `GitHub repository <https://github.com/HERA-Team/hera_stats>`_.
