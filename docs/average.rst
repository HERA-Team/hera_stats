Advanced power spectrum averaging functions
===========================================

The ``hera_stats.average`` module contains several advanced averaging functions for power spectra. Currently, this only consists of cumulative averaging in time or baseline-pair (`average_spectra_cumul`) and differencing redundant groups with respect to their average (`redundant_diff`).
